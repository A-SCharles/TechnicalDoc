      <p>Are you looking to build your own pc? You've come to the right place. I am going to show you a step by step way of building a PC. If you've never built a PC before, it might seem like an overwhelming task, but in actual fact, it's as simple as riding a bike.</p>
      <p>The first thing you want to do in any computer build is to plan your budget, and what your requirements are. Do you need a simple wokrstation PC, then look for parts that would be good for this avenue. If you need a super fast gaming PC, then look for higher spec items. You also need to put in consideration how big you want the sytem to be. The case size will affect how the components are configured and placed. We have listed the key components of a computer that you will want to start to identify what you will need at this stage below:</p>

        <p>The main component of any computer, all components are connected to and communicate via the motherboard. This makes it an important choice depending on your needs. Some motherboards come with more expansion slots than others in order for a user to customize it to there needs.</p>

        <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU<a /></strong></li>

        <p>The cpu is an important part of every computer. The CPU sends signals to control the other parts of the computer, almost like how a brain controls a body. The CPU is an electronic machine that works on a list of computer things to do, called instructions.Ensure that the CPU mathces the socket on the motherboard

        <p>Random access memory (RAM) is a computer's short-term memory, which it uses to handle all active tasks and apps. None of your programs, files, games, or streams would work without RAM.</p>

        <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage">Storage<a /></strong></li>

        <p>Where all your data will be kept, such as game files, work documents, multimedia content. The amount of storage you need is greatly influenced by what your requirements are.</p>

        <a href="https://www.evetech.co.za/msi-geforce-rtx-3090-gaming-x-trio-24gb/best-deal/9685.aspx?gclid=Cj0KCQiAosmPBhCPARIsAHOen-M80Dkb4jDZsH0AwKk0RVYwUGJdfutlYXTvV61c02wmQ26eCfhsbFQaAosrEALw_wcB" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.evetech.co.za/repository/ProductImages/msi-geforce-rtx-3090-gaming-x-trio-24gb-1000px-v1-0001.jpg" style="width:25%;"></a>
        <p>What does GPU stand for? Graphics processing unit, a specialized processor originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering. GPUs can process many pieces of data simultaneously, making them useful for machine learning, video editing, and gaming applications. Without this, gaming will be almost impossible as you will not be able to render all games to their full capacity by ujsing the CPU alone.</p>

        Now we'll begin to put all of your components together, when assembling a computer always make sure to wear an anti-static wrist wrap in order to ground yourself so that you do not short ourt your newly purchased equipment. Follow the steps below in order to assemble your PC.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove the motherboard from its box and place it on any non-conductive area, the motherboard box should be fine. Lift the cpu socket up using the small bar attached.</li>
        <li>Remove the CPU from its box and carefully align it with the small triangle on the CPU with the one on the motherboard. After it is safely installed, close the socket using the small bar attached. Place the CPU cooler on top of the CPU and tighten it according to the motherboard specifications.</li>
        <li>Line up your RAM sticks with the RAM slots on the motherboard and apply equal pressure on both ends when placing it into the slot until a click is heard. Repeat the process for the amount of RAM sticks you have.</li>
        <li>If you've bought an NVMe M.2 SSD, then it should be placed into it's slot at a 45 degree angle, placed down firmly, then screwed into the motherboard.</li>
        <li>Ensure that you I/O shield is in place before placing your motherboard inside your PC case. Make sure your motherboard sits firmly on all 9 standoffs before screwing the motherboard in place.</li>
        <li>Plug all front I/O cables into the motherboard.</li>
        <li>Install your PSU into the case and plug in thye necessary cables.</li>
        <li>Install your HDDs or SSds in the case by using SATA cables.</li>
        <li>Install the GPU into the PCIe x16 slot on the motherboard.</li>
      </ol>

        Now that you've completed the asssembly of your components, it's time to see if it all works. After plugging in all your peripherals, power on your PC, after a short while the monitor should display a list of your components information, which means it works and you've successfully built a working PC.
        If the screen remains blank however, power off the PC and check if all necessary cables are plugged in and all components are seated properly.</p>
